Unknown if I can do them
------------------------
Investigate more detailed summary screen
Add a 'record a performance' option with playback
Add 'virtual' folder support so you can have 1 copy of the song, and have it in multiple places (by genre, difficulty, alphabetically, artist, etc)



Ongoing efforts
---------------
Optimize performance of the mod
Optimize some of the note loops to make them more efficient (dont traverse entire loop)
More general optimizations (lag bad!)
work on garbage collection for whatever is hogging up memory
