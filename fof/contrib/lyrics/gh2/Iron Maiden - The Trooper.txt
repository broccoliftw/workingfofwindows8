39000	1000	text	You'll take my life
40100	1500	text	But I'll take yours too
41700	2900	text	You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
44700	2900	text	So when you're waiting for the next attack
47700	3000	text	You'd better stand there's no turning back
50800	2900	text	The Bugle sounds, the charge begins
53700	3000	text	But on this battlefield no one wins
56800	3000	text	The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
59900	2700	text	As I plunge on into certain death
62900	4500	text	Oooooooohh!
68000	5500	text	Oooooooohh!
98300	3300	text	The horse, he sweats, with fear we break to run
101700	2900	text	The mighty roar of the Russian guns
104600	3100	text	And as we race towards the human wall
108100	2700	text	The screams of pain as my comrades fall
111100	2500	text	We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
113700	2900	text	And the Russians fire another round
117000	2600	text	We get so near, yet so far away
120000	2500	text	We won't live to fight another day
122600	4400	text	Oooooooohh!
127600	5300	text	Oooooooohh!
205100	3100	text	We get so close, near enough to fight
208300	2900	text	When a Russian gets me in his sights
211300	3100	text	He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
214000	2000	text	A burst of rounds take my horse below
216000	3100	text	And as I lay there gazing at the sky
219700	2600	text	My body's numb and my throat is dry
223000	2500	text	And as I lay forgotten and alone
225200	2800	text	Without a tear I draw my parting groan
228100	4500	text	Oooooooohh!
233000	5300	text	Oooooooohh!
