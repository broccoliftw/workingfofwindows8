50000	5000	text	Generals gathered in their masses
55000	5000	text	Just like witches at black masses
61000	5000	text	Evil minds that plot destruction
67000	5000	text	Sorcerers of death's construction
73000	4000	text	In the fields the bodies burning
77000	6000	text	As the war machine keeps turning
84000	5000	text	Death and hatred to mankind
89000	3000	text	Poisoning their brainwashed minds
92000	2000	text	Oh Lord, yeah
125000	4000	text	Politicians hide themselves away
130000	3000	text	They only started the war
135000	5000	text	Why should they go out to fight
140000	4000	text	They leave that role to the poor
145000	1000	text	Yeah
156000	4000	text	Time will tell on their power minds
161000	4000	text	Making war just for fun
166000	5000	text	Treating people just like pawns in chess
172000	3000	text	Wait till their judgement day comes
176000	1000	text	Yeah
262000	6000	text	Now in darkness world stops turning
268000	5000	text	Ashes where the bodies burning
273000	5000	text	No more war pigs of the power
279000	4000	text	Hand of God has struck the hour
284000	6000	text	Day of judgement, God is calling
290000	5000	text	On their knees the war pigs crawling
295000	5000	text	Begging mercies for their sins
300000	4000	text	Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
304000	2000	text	Oh Lord, yeah
