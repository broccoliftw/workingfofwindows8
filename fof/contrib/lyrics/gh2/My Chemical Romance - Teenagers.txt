3500	1700	text	They're gonna clean up your looks
5500	1700	text	With all the lies in the books
7500	4020	text	To make a citizen out of you
12500	1700	text	Because they sleep with a gun
14500	1700	text	And keep an eye on you, son
16500	3700	text	So they can watch all the things you do
20500	2910	text	Because the drugs never work
23710	1960	text	They're gonna give you a smirk
25970	3700	text	'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
29970	2010	text	They're gonna rip up your heads
32280	1920	text	Your aspirations to shreds
34500	3200	text	Another cog in the murder machine
38000	2780	text	They said all teenagers scare
41080	2440	text	The living **** out of me
43820	3680	text	They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
47800	3600	text	So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
51700	3100	text	Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
55100	2920	text	The boys and girls in the clique
58320	1850	text	The awful names that they stick
60470	3130	text	You're never gonna fit in much, kid
64430	1770	text	But if you're troubled and hurt
66500	1900	text	What you got under your shirt
68700	3500	text	Will make them pay for the things that they did
72500	2840	text	They said all teenagers scare
75640	1780	text	The living **** out of me
78500	3700	text	They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
82500	3300	text	So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
86100	3100	text	Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
89500	2090	text	Ohhh yeah!
106630	2540	text	They said all teenagers scare
109470	1930	text	The living **** out of me
111700	3900	text	They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
115900	3700	text	So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
119900	2900	text	Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
123100	1580	text	All together now!
124980	3490	text	Teenagers scare the living **** out of me
128770	4050	text	They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
133120	3650	text	So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
137070	3130	text	Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
141730	3720	text	Teenagers scare the living **** out of me
145750	3950	text	They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
150000	3450	text	So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
