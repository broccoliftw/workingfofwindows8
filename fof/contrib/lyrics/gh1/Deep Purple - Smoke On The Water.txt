55000	3500	text	We all came out to Montreux
58800	3800	text	On the Lake Geneva shoreline
63900	3300	text	To make records with a mobile
69200	2400	text	We didn't have much time
72400	3300	text	Oh Frank Zappa and the Mothers
76000	3100	text	Were at the best place around
80800	3100	text	But some stupid with a flare gun
84800	900	text	Burned the place
85800	1600	text	To the ground
88900	4100	text	Smoke on the water
93500	2200	text	A fire in the sky
97500	4300	text	Smoke on the water
118800	3300	text	It burned down the gambling house
122500	2900	text	It died with an awful sound
127300	1400	text	Ah Funky Claude
128800	2300	text	Was running in and out
132900	2200	text	Pulling kids out the ground
136000	2900	text	When it all was over
139400	2800	text	We had to find another place
144100	3100	text	But Swiss time was running out
147800	3100	text	It seemed that we would lose the race
152200	4100	text	Smoke on the water
156700	2300	text	A fire in the sky
160700	4300	text	Smoke on the water
240000	1400	text	We ended up at the
241600	2200	text	Grand Hotel
244400	1300	text	It was empty
245900	1100	text	Cold and bare
247200	2700	text	But with the rolling truck stones thing
250100	2100	text	Just outside
252800	2700	text	Hah, making our music there
255700	1900	text	With a few red lights
258100	1800	text	A few old beds
260700	2400	text	We made a place to sweat
264800	1200	text	No matter what
266400	1700	text	We get out of this
269000	800	text	I know
270100	2200	text	I know we'll never forget
272900	4000	text	Smoke on the water
277400	2200	text	A fire in the sky
281300	3700	text	Smoke on the water
