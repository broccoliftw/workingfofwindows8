22410	3200	text	You sit there in your heartache 
26010	3190	text	Waiting on some beautiful boy to 
29600	3220	text	To save you from your old ways 
33220	1200	text	You play forgiveness 
34520	1860	text	Watch it now, here he comes
36580	3150	text	He doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
40130	2250	text	But he talks like a gentleman 
42580	4660	text	Like you imagined when you were young 
51650	1600	text	Can we climb this mountain 
53350	1800	text	I don't know 
55250	3060	text	Higher now than ever before 
58710	3410	text	I know we can make it if we take it slow 
62520	1600	text	Let's take it easy 
64220	1500	text	Easy now, watch it go 
66120	3050	text	We're burning down the highway skyline 
69570	3310	text	On the back of a hurricane that started turning 
73680	4200	text	When you were young 
80140	4950	text	When you were young 
87800	2800	text	And sometimes you close your eyes 
91000	3170	text	And see the place where you used to live
95400	3060	text	When you were young 
119390	3410	text	They say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet 
123600	3370	text	You don't have to drink right now
128150	3300	text	But you can dip your feet 
131850	4610	text	Every once in a little while 
158240	3400	text	You sit there in your heartache 
162040	3060	text	Waiting on some beautiful boy to 
165500	3210	text	To save you from your old ways 
169110	1590	text	You play forgiveness 
170800	1660	text	Watch it now, here he comes 
172560	3300	text	He doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
176260	1860	text	But he talks like a gentleman 
178220	4480	text	Like you imagined when you were young 
183500	1930	text	He talks like a gentlemen
185630	1600	text	Like you imagined when
187330	4760	text	When you were young 
194040	3800	text	I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
202040	3560	text	He doesn't look a thing like Jesus 
208150	2910	text	But more than you'll ever know
