# Scripted by V4Vendetta for Rock the 80s Encore
13800  4000 text I never meant to be so bad to you
18400  5000 text One thing I said that I would never do
23700  4700 text A look from you and I would fall from grace
28600  5000 text & that would wipe this smile right from my face
35100  3500 text Do you remember when we used to dance
39300  4000 text And incidence arose from circumstance
44100  4000 text One thing lead to another we were young
49300  5500 text And we would scream together songs unsung
55000  3400 text It was the heat of the moment
58500  3700 text Telling me what your heart meant
62400  6500 text The Heat of the moment shown in your eyes
69400  3500 text And now you find yourself in 82
73900  3100 text The disco hotspots hold no charm for you
78500  4000 text You cant concern yourself with bigger things
83500  5200 text You catch the pearl and ride the dragons wings
88600  3400 text Cause its the heat of the moment
93000  2800 text heat of the moment
96500  3000 text The heat of the moment
99500  7000 text shown in your eyes
112000 100  text cock
134000 3800 text And when your looks are gone and youre alone
138400 4200 text How many nights you sit beside the phone
143000 2800 text What were the things you wanted for yourself
147100 4800 text Teenage ambition you remember well
152200 3400 text It was the heat of the moment
156800 3700 text Telling me what your heart meant
160300 2400 text The Heat of the moment 
163000 3000 text shown in your eyes
167000 3000 text It was the heat of the moment
170800 2800 text heat of the moment
173800 2800 text heat of the moment
177000 3500 text shown in your eyes
180600 4000 text eyesssssss
212000 2800 text heat of the moment
215000 2800 text heat of the moment
